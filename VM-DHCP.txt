Transfer Files Between Two Virtual Machines Using NAT and DHC**1. Create the First Virtual Machine (VM1):**
 - Open VirtualBox.
 - Click on "New".
 - Enter a name (e.g., VM1, vm01, VM0001). Use a different format if there is a naming conflict.
 - Select Type: Linux, Version: Ubuntu (64-bit).
 - For the hard disk, select "Use an existing virtual hard disk file".
 - Choose the Ubuntu .vdi file. If it's not visible, click "Add" and manually select it.


**2. Create the Second Virtual Machine (VM2):**
 - Repeat Step 1.
 - Use a different name (e.g., VM2, vm02, VM002, etc.).


**3. Configure NAT Network:**
 - In VirtualBox, go to File -> Tools -> NAT Networks.
 - Make sure there is a NAT network listed. If not, click the plus (+) icon to create one.


**4. Configure Network Settings for VM1:**
 - Select VM1 -> Settings -> Network.
 - Set Attached to: NAT Network.

 - Click OK.


**5. Configure Network Settings for VM2:**
 - Select VM2 -> Settings -> Network.
 - Set Attached to: NAT Network.
 - In Advanced -> Promiscuous Mode, choose Allow All.
 - Click OK.


**6. Start Both VMs:**
 - Launch both VM1 and VM2.
 - Login with:
 - Username: vagrant
 - Password: vagrant


**7. Install Networking Tools:**
 - On both VMs, open Terminal and run: sudo apt install net-tools
 - After installation, check IP addresses using: ifconfig
 - Ensure both VMs have different inet IP addresses (e.g., 10.0.2.10, 10.0.2.11).


**8. Create a File on VM1:**
 - In VM1, run:
 touch file.txt
 nano file.txt
 - Inside the editor, type any message (e.g., HELLO), then press: Ctrl + X -> Y -> Enter.
 - Confirm content using: cat file.txt


**9. Transfer File from VM1 to VM2:**
 - On VM1, run: scp file.txt vagrant@<VM2-IP>:/home/vagrant
 - Replace <VM2-IP> with the actual IP of VM2 (found using ifconfig).
 - Type yes when prompted.
 - Enter the password: vagrant


**10. Verify File on VM2:**
 - On VM2, run:
 ls
 cat file.txt
