# Multiplication Table of 5
for x in range(1, 11):
    print '5 X', x, '=', 5 * x
print ''

# Factorial
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
factorial_result = factorial(5)
print '\nFactorial of 5 is:', factorial_result
print ''

# Repeated User Details
name = 'Aman Kumar'

department = 'IT'
for _ in range(5):
    print 'Name: ', name
    print 'Seat Number: ', seat_number
    print 'Department: ', department
    print ''

# Fibonacci Series
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        print a,
        a, b = b, a + b
print 'Fibonacci series up to 5 terms:'
fibonacci(5)
print '\n'

# Prime Numbers
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
print 'Prime numbers from 1 to 5:'
for i in range(1, 6):
    if is_prime(i):
        print i,
print '\n'

# Armstrong Numbers
def is_armstrong(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    power = len(num_str)
    total = sum(int(d)**power for d in num_str)
    return total == n
print 'Armstrong numbers from 1 to 500:'
for i in range(1, 501):
    if is_armstrong(i):
        print i,
print '\n'
